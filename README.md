# simple-react-app
Just like it's name this react app is nothing but a simple application to implement the basics of react.  

There are 7 pages in the app and in the bold are the concepts that I learned.  

- *Temperature Converter* -> **Lifting State Up**
- *Simple Form* -> **Forms**  
- *Multiplication Table* -> **Lists & Keys**  
    
- *Simple Color Mixer* -> **Conditional Rendering**  
    
- *Counter & ON/OFF Switch* -> **Handling Events**  
    
- *Date Display* -> **State & Lifecycle**

All the topics mentioned above in bold can be read in detail from the official
[**React Docs**](https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html)
